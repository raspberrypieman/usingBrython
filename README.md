Examples of using Brython to create web pages

chartJSexample.html - This, together with its companion, chartJSexample.py, is an example of using 
Brython together with Canvas.js (https://canvasjs.com) to produce some simple charts.
Ideally, I would have liked to do everything in Brython, however, this is as compact I cam make the Javascript part. If anyone can suggest a way to minimise it further or to fully do without the Javascript I would be appreciate any suggestions.
